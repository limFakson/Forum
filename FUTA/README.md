Mr Backend you are to use for loops for the post
I created three posts and three videos just for sample to see how multiple videos will look like on the homepage
I'm still working on the hompage though, I need to fix some JS issues


<!--Joshua Part-->
The UserProfile works like this, it a dropdown and it sticks and create's new UserProfile when a logined user create's a Profile, so let say tom registers now, he will login automatically after filling in is details and hits submit button.
A profile will act as the second step in the registration, and if not filled homepage can't be entered.

I hope this explains in details
